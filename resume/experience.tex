    {Graduate Student Researcher}
    {Personalized Domain Expert Recommendation on QA Websites}
    {UCLA}
    {Aug. 2017 - Present}
    {
    	\begin{cvitems}
    		\item {Learnt the similarity between users from user network structure information and accepted-answer ranking information to provide personalized and best answering candidates for recommendation given the question proposed by a specific user.}
    		\item {Jointly optimized network embedding similarity loss between users and ranking loss amoung answers. Used Bidirectional LSTM for learning the representations of question contents.}
    		\item {Implementd the proposed algorithm in Python and TensorFlow.}
    	\end{cvitems}
    }

    {Graduate Student Researcher}
    {All Case Reports with Open Biomedical Annotation Terms (ACROBAT)}
    {UCLA}
    {Jul. 2017 - Present}
    {
    	\begin{cvitems}
			\item {To implement an automatic case report annotation tool to identify the typed  medical entities, relationships, and temporal information to construct a graphical representation of a case report describing the treatment-disease development. Learn the representation of heterogeneous graphs for achieving high accuracy similarity search query and finding undocumented relationships between medical entities.}
			\item {Worked on Temporal Expression Extraction by introducing new hand-crafted rules to SUTime and collaborating with an Regex section.}
    	\end{cvitems}

	{Course Project}
	{Forecasting the best answers in community-based question answering services}
	{UCLA}
	{Apr. 2017 - Jun. 2017}
	{
		\begin{cvitems}
			\item {To automatically predict the best answer of questions in community-based question answering forum, such as Stack Overflow. Four types of features are employed: statistical and meta features, social network, user expertise features, and natural language features.}
			\item {Used LambdaMART, one of the state of the art learning to rank models, to learn the answers' ranking and select the highest as the predicted ``best answer''}
			\item {Empirical results show that proposed model outperforms all baselines and enhances the 7\% of the average P\@1.}
