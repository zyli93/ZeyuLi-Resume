    {
    	\begin{cvitems}
    		\item {Learnt the similarity between users from user network structure information and accepted-answer ranking information to provide personalized and best answering candidates for recommendation given the question proposed by a specific user.}
    		\item {Jointly optimized network embedding similarity loss between users and ranking loss amoung answers. Used Bidirectional LSTM for learning the representations of question contents.}

    {UCLA}
    {Jul. 2017 - Present}
    {
    	\begin{cvitems}
			\item {To implement a case report auto-annotation tool to identify the typed medical entities, relationships, and temporal information to construct graphical representation of treatment-disease development. Learn the representation of heterogeneous graphs for achieving high accuracy similarity search query and finding undocumented relationships between medical entities.}

  {Course Project | \textit{Python, PyTorch}}
  {Adversarial Gender-debiased Word Embedding}
  {UCLA}
  {Oct. 2017 - Dec. 2017}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Built an adversarial model to learn gender-debiased word embedding and extracted the invariant information by jointly encoding the gender information and the invariant and feeding the encoded to 
        \textit{Discriminator}.}
        \item {Occupation project evaluation and word analogy test show that our model indeed removed the gender stereotype and achieved gender-debiased word embedding.}
    \end{cvitems}

\cventry
  {Course Project | \textit{Numpy, Sci-kit Learn}}
	{Forecasting the Best Answers in Community-based Question Answering Services}
	{UCLA}
	{Apr. 2017 - Jun. 2017}
	{
		\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Automatically predicted best answers of questions in community-based QA forum (e.g. Stack Overflow). Four types of features are employed: statistical and meta features, social network, user expertise features, and natural language features.}
			\item {Used LambdaMART, one of the state of the art learning to rank models, to learn and select the highest answer as the prediction}
			\item {Empirical results show that proposed model outperforms all baselines and enhances the 7\% of the average $P@1$.}
